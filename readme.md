# Linux Installation Guide
---
This section covers introductory material regarding the general organization of the guide.

## Foreword

The first time I attempted to install a Linux distro, I came across several good guides. However, I found it difficult to piece what I learned together as each guide tended to have the following issues:

1. Heavily Opionated
2. 

### How to read this Guide

This guide is intended to be read by beginners in Linux. It is assumed that the reader has very little prior knowledge. This guide is not meant to be purely an instruction manual. For this reason, context will be provided regarding the code run by the author during the installation, with references to the relevant sources where applicable. T is to provide readers with the tools to solve any issues they come across. In addition, while running arbitrary code from the internet is tempting, and the author is very much guilty of doing so at times, it's a very dangerous practice, and should be avoided. The reader is strongly encouraged to only run code they understand.

It is very likely that by the time you are reading this guide, it will be out of date. The version information for every tool used througout this guide is specified when relevant. The reader is strongly encouraged to use those versions, even if they are outdated. This ensures that the reader's experience will be as close as possible to the author's. Once the installation is complete, the reader is then encouraged to update their tooling as needed. Further, it is strongly recommended to proceed with updates with caution. Sometimes, new versions can cause things to break. For this reason, tooling should be updated one tool at a time, not all at once. This makes it a lot easier to identify which tool may be causing issues.

Finally, I close with a note to the reader.
